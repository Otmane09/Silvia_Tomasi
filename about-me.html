                    <span><p>I have always been passionate about pastry.

                        As I was a child I was always used to baking cakes for my family. Sunday was the perfect day to spend my time in the kitchen with my mom baking an easy homemade cake for a coffee break after our lunch.
                        This passion started with an easy ricotta cream crumble cake but every time I baked it I was used to change something...maybe adding chocolate chips or sliced pear. This way of baking and creating something new drives me where I am now. 
                        I was curious about knowing how to bake not only a cake following a recipe step by step but also creating my own recipes through a deep study of the ingredients and different techniques. Nothing could stop me anymore. A thirst to learn that never leaves me. It was therefore alone, through training and research that I perfected myself. And after I decided to start my study in Vienna at the age of 22 attending the pastry school and at the same time working in an old Viennese coffee house. There I learn the basics and the theory and in my free time I was always in my kitchen trying out new recipes and never giving up. 
                        
                        That’s how I turned my passion into my work.</p></span>
